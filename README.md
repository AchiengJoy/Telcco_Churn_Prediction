# Telcco_Churn_Prediction

Customer churn refers to the situation when a firm or service loses customers or subscribers.

In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, customers have many service providers to choose from and frequently switch between them. The annual churn rate for this sector ranges between 15% and 25%.

Because most firms have a large number of customers, it is challenging to provide individualized customer retention efforts to each of them. Devoting excessive time and resources to each customer is not feasible, as it would outweigh the additional revenue. However, if a company could anticipate which customers are likely to discontinue their services, it could focus retention efforts solely on these "high risk" clients. Ultimately, the goal is to expand the customer base and enhance customer loyalty, which is the key to success in this market.

Customer churn is a vital metric because it is less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. To minimize customer churn, telecommunications firms must predict which customers are at high risk of leaving.

To detect early signs of potential churn, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the customers and their interactions across various channels, such as in-store visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, web-based transactions, and social media interactions.
